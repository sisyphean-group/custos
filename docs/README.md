## Introduction

Custos protects your machine from unauthorized USB devices. Use an explit policy list to block/allow devices based on their USB attributes. Custos' daemon monitors USB events and applies these policies in real time. It is intentionally kept as simple as possible in order to:

- Keep the codebase small.
- Be light on system resources.
- Be easy to understand, audit, and contribute to.

## NixOS Module

Custos provides a NixOS module to easily deploy it on NixOS systems.
The module lives in [`nix/module.nix`](./nix/module.nix) and can be used to setup and confgiure the daemon and the policy list.

```nix
{ inputs, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports = [
    inputs.custos.nixosModules.default
  ];

  services.custos = {
    enable = true;

    # Users which are allowed to control the daemon.
    controlUsers = [ "alice" ];

    config = {
      # Enforce the policies in the policy list.
      mode = "enforce";

      # The path to the policy file. This is
      # /etc/custos/policy.toml by default.
      policy_path = "/etc/custos/policy.toml";
      # The path to the control socket used by
      # the CLI to talk to the daemon. This is
      # set to /run/custos/control.sock by default.
      socket_path = "/run/custos/control.sock";
      # The root of the sysfs filesystem to interface with.
      sysfs_root = "/sys";
      # Don't allow an empty policy file. Allowing this *can*
      # cause lockouts by disallowing all usb devices.
      unsafe_allow_empty_policy = false;
      default_action = "block";
      controllers = {
        # Block new USB devices by default.
        authorized_default = "none";
        # Don't restore the controller state on shutdown. This means that if the daemon is stopped while some devices are blocked, they will remain blocked.
        restore_on_shutdown = false;
      };
    };

    # A list of policies to apply.
    policy.rules = [
      {
        name = "built-in keyboard";
        action = "allow";
        match = {
          vendor_id = "6767";
          product_id = "1337";
          connect_type = "hardwired";
          is_hub = false;
          interfaces.any = [ "03:*:*" ];
        };
      }
    ];
  };
}
```

The module:

- Generates `/etc/custos/config.toml` directly from `services.custos.config`.
- Generates `/etc/custos/policy.toml` directly from `services.custos.policy`.
- Adds the `custos` package to `environment.systemPackages`.
- Creates a control group, default `custos`.
- Adds `services.custos.controlUsers` to that group.
- Creates the control socket directory with mode `2770`.
- Starts `systemd.services.custos` with
  `custos --daemon --config /etc/custos/config.toml`.
- Grants the service write access to the socket directory and the configured USB
  sysfs devices directory.

The socket itself is created by the daemon with mode `0660`. Users in the
configured control group can run daemon-backed CLI commands without root.

### Module Options

| Option                         | Default                      | Meaning                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `services.custos.enable`       | `false`                      | Enable the daemon and generated files.                 |
| `services.custos.package`      | flake package                | Package to run.                                        |
| `services.custos.config`       | daemon defaults              | Raw TOML attrset written to `/etc/custos/config.toml`. |
| `services.custos.policy`       | `{ default = "block"; ... }` | Raw TOML attrset written to `/etc/custos/policy.toml`. |
| `services.custos.group`        | `"custos"`                   | Group that owns the control socket directory.          |
| `services.custos.controlUsers` | `[ ]`                        | Users added to the control group.                      |

The module does not try to semantically validate policies at evaluation time.
It only renders Nix attrsets to TOML; lockout checks and empty-matcher checks
are handled by `custos validate` and daemon startup:

- In enforce mode, startup requires at least one `allow` rule that can match a
  non-hub endpoint, unless `unsafe_allow_empty_policy = true`.
- Every policy rule must have at least one match field.

## Commands

`custos` is both the daemon binary and the CLI.

### Daemon

```sh
custos --daemon
custos --daemon --config /etc/custos/config.toml
custos --daemon --dry-run
custos --daemon --unsafe-empty-policy
```

Daemon flags:

- `--daemon` starts enforcement.
- `--config PATH` selects the daemon config file.
- `--dry-run` overrides the loaded config mode to `dry-run`.
- `--unsafe-empty-policy` permits startup without an endpoint allow policy.

`--daemon` cannot be combined with subcommands or `--json`.

### Daemon-Backed CLI

These commands talk to the daemon over the Unix domain socket. Each accepts
`--socket PATH`; each supports `--json`.

```sh
custos status
custos devices
custos reload
custos dry-run-reload
custos allow <device-id>
custos block <device-id>
custos clear-override <device-id>
```

Command behavior:

- `status` prints daemon mode, device count, override count, socket path, and
  policy path as a report table.
- `devices` lists the daemon's current device snapshot and decision for each
  device as a report table.
- `reload` loads the policy from disk, validates it, applies it, and replaces
  the active policy if successful.
- `dry-run-reload` loads and validates the policy from disk, reports decisions,
  and does not replace the active policy.
- `allow <device-id>` creates a manual allow override and writes authorization
  immediately.
- `block <device-id>` creates a manual block override and writes authorization
  immediately.
- `clear-override <device-id>` removes a manual override and reapplies the
  active policy immediately.

Human output uses boxed Unicode report tables. JSON output is unchanged and is
intended for scripts. In device tables:

- `AUTHORIZED` is the current kernel/sysfs authorization state.
- `ACTION` is the policy or manual-override decision that Custos wants.

These can differ in `dry-run` output, before enforcement has run, if a device
disappears during a write, or if something outside Custos changes sysfs.

Device IDs are daemon-local runtime IDs from `custos devices`. They are stable
across refreshes for the same device identity, but they are not a persistent
policy identifier.

### Local Commands

These commands do not talk to the daemon.

```sh
custos dry-run
custos dry-run --config /path/to/config.toml
custos dry-run --json

custos validate
custos validate --config /path/to/config.toml
custos validate --dry-run
custos validate --unsafe-empty-policy

custos generate-policy
custos generate-policy --sysfs-root /sys
```

Command behavior:

- `dry-run` reads config and policy, scans current sysfs, and prints boxed
  reports showing what would be applied without writing sysfs.
- `validate` checks config, policy syntax, policy rule validation, and startup
  lockout rules, then prints a validation report.
- `generate-policy` scans currently connected devices and prints an initial
  allow policy to stdout.

`validate` and `generate-policy` do not support `--json`. `generate-policy`
intentionally prints raw TOML so it can be redirected to a policy file.

## How Enforcement Works

1. The daemon loads config from `/etc/custos/config.toml` by default. A missing
   config file falls back to built-in defaults.
2. The daemon loads the policy from `policy_path`.
3. Before enforcing, the daemon refuses to start unless the policy has at least
   one `allow` rule that can match a non-hub USB endpoint. This prevents a
   first-run lockout. Dry-run mode and `unsafe_allow_empty_policy = true` bypass
   this guard.
4. The daemon binds the control socket and opens the USB kernel uevent monitor.
   If the monitor cannot be opened, startup fails.
5. The daemon scans `${sysfs_root}/bus/usb/devices`, skipping root hubs and
   non-`usb_device` entries.
6. Each scanned device becomes a device state: the sysfs facts plus the current
   policy decision.
7. In enforce mode, the daemon writes each device's `authorized` sysfs file. In
   dry-run mode, it logs what it would write.
8. The daemon listens for USB kernel uevents and rescans after relevant USB
   device changes.
9. If the uevent monitor fails after startup, the daemon exits with an error so
   systemd can restart it.

Relevant uevents are USB device events with:

- `SUBSYSTEM=usb`
- `DEVTYPE=usb_device`
- `ACTION` in `add`, `bind`, `change`, `remove`, or `unbind`

The daemon logs device connections, removals, decision changes, explicit policy
allow/block decisions, manual overrides, and cleared overrides.

### Device Identity

Runtime device IDs are assigned by the daemon. The ID mapping is keyed by:

- sysfs path
- vendor ID
- product ID
- serial, if present

Manual overrides are keyed the same way. Overrides survive refreshes for the
same identity and are removed when the identity disappears from the current
snapshot.

### Hubs

With policy default `block`, hubs are allowed by default with reason
`USB hub passthrough`. This keeps downstream devices visible so the daemon can
evaluate and authorize them individually.

Add an explicit hub rule if you want different hub behavior:

```toml
[[rules]]
name = "block all hubs"
action = "block"

[rules.match]
is_hub = true
```

## Config TOML

Default config path:

```text
/etc/custos/config.toml
```

Example:

```toml
mode = "enforce"
policy_path = "/etc/custos/policy.toml"
socket_path = "/run/custos/control.sock"
sysfs_root = "/sys"
unsafe_allow_empty_policy = false
default_action = "block"

[controllers]
authorized_default = "none"
restore_on_shutdown = false
```

Controller `authorized_default` values map to sysfs writes:

- `"keep"`: do not touch controller defaults.
- `"none"`: write `0`.
- `"all"`: write `1`.

## Policy TOML

Default policy path:

```text
/etc/custos/policy.toml
```

Example:

```toml
default = "block"

[[rules]]
name = "built-in keyboard"
action = "allow"

[rules.match]
vendor_id = "feed"
product_id = "1307"
connect_type = "hardwired"
descriptor_hash = "base64-sha256-descriptor-hash"
is_hub = false

[rules.match.interfaces]
any = ["03:*:*"]
```

Policy fields:

| Field            | Type                   | Meaning                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`        | `"allow"` or `"block"` | Action when no rule matches.                         |
| `rules`          | array                  | Ordered rules. First matching rule wins.             |
| `rules[].name`   | string                 | Non-empty rule name. Used in decisions and logs.     |
| `rules[].action` | `"allow"` or `"block"` | Action for matching devices.                         |
| `rules[].match`  | table                  | Device matcher. Must contain at least one criterion. |

Matcher fields use TOML snake_case:

| Field             | Meaning                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vendor_id`       | Four hexadecimal USB vendor ID. Case-insensitive.                            |
| `product_id`      | Four hexadecimal USB product ID. Case-insensitive.                           |
| `serial`          | Exact USB serial string.                                                     |
| `product_name`    | Exact USB product string.                                                    |
| `connect_type`    | Exact kernel `connect_type`, such as `hardwired` or `hotplug`.               |
| `port_path`       | Exact sysfs USB port path, such as `1-2` or `3-1.4`.                         |
| `descriptor_hash` | Base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of the device `descriptors` file.                |
| `is_hub`          | Boolean hub matcher.                                                         |
| `interfaces.any`  | At least one listed interface pattern must match. Empty means no constraint. |
| `interfaces.all`  | Every listed interface pattern must match at least one device interface.     |

Interface patterns use `cc:ss:pp`, where each segment is two hex digits or `*`:

```toml
[rules.match.interfaces]
any = ["03:*:*"]
all = ["03:01:01", "03:00:*"]
```

Rule validation:

- Rule names cannot be empty.
- A matcher cannot be empty.
- `vendor_id` and `product_id` must be exactly four hex characters.
- String matcher values cannot be empty.
- Interface patterns must have exactly three segments.

## Starting Safely

The workflow for getting this project up and running is approximately:

1. Run `custos generate-policy > policy.toml` while the desired baseline devices
   are plugged in.
2. Review and edit the generated policy; remove devices you do not want to be
   allowed.
3. Create a `config.toml` that points `policy_path` at the reviewed policy.
4. Run `custos validate --config ./config.toml`.
5. Run `custos dry-run --config ./config.toml`.
6. Enable the NixOS module or start `custos --daemon --config ./config.toml` as
   superuser.

To intentionally test without a policy:

```sh
custos --daemon --dry-run --unsafe-empty-policy
```

Avoid enforcing an empty or unreviewed policy unless you have another way back
into the machine. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BORK YOUR SYSTEM.
